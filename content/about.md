## The Manifesto

The logic is simple, so we can keep things short and sweet:

Things are insanely messed up in this world.

Things look really, really bad.

As creatives and cultural workers, we feel it.

Our art gets thrown into the extractive social media ether; sapped by media conglomerates that reach lots of people, but not without forcing us to compromise on our artistic integrity first; or, if we’re lucky, channeled into membership/subscription models that might mean financial success and sustenance, but not without some degree of isolation and a lack of real community with other creators.

It feels like culture is dying, being sucked dry by megacorporations and world systems that make it harder for us to survive and, as a result, create.

It feels like we have no more control. It even feels like there isn’t another way.

We’re tired. Very tired.

**But we’re here.**

Whether we want to be or not.

**We’re alive.**

Even if it feels like we aren’t at times. Even if it feels like we’re dead people walking. Even if it feels like we’re shells of our former selves.

**We’re here.**

And there is another way…

The odds are against us.

But that doesn’t mean the odds are relevant…

At the end of the day, all of us have the same two choices:

_Remain stagnant, assuming that the worst will happen, feeling the only other option is to sit still and take little-to-no action with naive dreams of things magically changing for the better._

Or…

_Actively push for something different with others… by doing things differently._

_**Very differently.**_

For Jaded – as a network and collective of creatives – “doing things differently” means:

1. Producing and distributing art and events cooperatively/democratically _(without bosses and shareholders standing over our shoulders)_.

2. Using the resources generated through cooperative/democratic production and distribution to service **humans/creatives** (via creator survival funds, housing, and more), **creation** (via art funds, tool-sharing, new technology, and more), **culture,** the **humans who support creators and events,** and the **shaping of cooperative/democratic communities** all around the world (not just in the arts/entertainment).

3. Not being absorbed (ensuring our institutions are unbuyable and ungovernable – this means no selling of our organizations or operations to exploitative corporations, large or small, that are uninterested in democratizing and supporting cooperative labor and transformative world-building as a whole).

## The Principles

### Cooperative

This means that we work with each other in a horizontal way instead of organizing ourselves under vertical, centralized, and hierarchical exploitation. As a cooperative network, all workers involved have the option to “own” and/or control Jaded institutions together, instead of all operations being dictated from above by a few shareholders who are only interested in a return on investments and profit.

### Directly Democratic

This means that we decide things ourselves, don’t believe in having “representatives” or “delegates” decide _all_ things for us inside or outside of our organizations _as a default,_ and in the cases where we do wish for people within our organizations to represent us on the inside or the outside, we have the option of recalling them _instantly_ if we have an issue or change our minds.

### Human-Centered

This means that our ultimate aims and goals are around serving the cultural laborers within our organizations, their communities, and the broader subcultures that they nurture (instead of profit or capital accumulation). There is no getting around money and the broader elements of our global economy under our present systems, but we choose to navigate “business” in a way that prioritizes the survival and dignity of the humans who make everything go.

### Intersectional

This means that our organizations will account for dynamics around representation, understanding that there are multiple, interconnected layers of oppression impacting different people within our society in different ways (along axes of class, race, gender, sexuality, and more), and that this calls for all of our creative institutions to have measures in place that ensure the most disenfranchised have a say along with everyone else.

### Global

This means that we don’t believe borders and nation-state boundaries should limit our collaboration with creatives in other places around the world. We seek to contribute to a global media network where people with shared values in different cultural contexts can reinforce each other's efforts. The logic here is simple: _**we are stronger together.**_

### Independent

This means that we are uninterested in uniting with traditional capitalist firms or governments of any kind (domestic or foreign), and seek to build out on our own platforms/technologies controlled by us + designed to serve the commons (real-world and digital). **We understand that, as a means to survive, members of our organizations will each have their own particular relationships with “outside” institutions we consider exploitative or oppressive, but the understanding through Jaded networks is that the spaces we open up will serve as a refuge from the logics that define these institutions and the status quo, and lend themselves to systems change.**

## The Structure

Jaded represents an international network of cooperative and creative ecosystems we call “hubs” that are made up of institutions called “worker cooperatives.” Worker cooperatives – and more specifically Worker Self-Directed Enterprises (WSDEs) – are businesses that are democratically “owned” and/or controlled by all of its workers, as well as representatives from surrounding communities.

Each local Jaded hub is made up of various creative institutions that are interconnected and rooted in direct democracy (meaning everyone decides things directly and together under consent and consensus decision-making processes), as well as the “circles” governance structure (more on that here). Each local Jaded hub also decides its own affairs in accordance with our principles as a global network, and can even fork off/out of the Jaded network if there are crucial disagreements or conflicts around principles. Hubs stay connected through a general “circle” council made up of at least two delegates from each respective hub.

The first Jaded hub is in NYC, its flagship institutions being [**Jaded Forum**](/forum) – a show hosted by comedians/artists Yedoye Travis, Connor Boyd, and Z that includes community discussion, live performances, and parties – **Jaded Records,** and **Jaded Magazine (in development).** Jaded Forum as a show – and the first project of Jaded as a global collective – is structured under a multi-stakeholder co-op model, which means there are various levels of membership within the institution, and a range of percentages in terms of how much of any surplus generated is distributed to co-owners and/or members. _As of March 2022, the particulars of this are still being determined by co-founders._

All new hubs must be approved by vote amongst all Jaded hubs and/or their delegates to be considered official parts of the global Jaded network.

There is no “central command” that issues orders or makes decisions from the top down through Jaded networks – all local Jaded hubs around the world have autonomy, associate with each other on their own terms (in free association, guided by our shared principles), and, under “liquid democracy,” have the options to vote directly themselves, or democratically elect instantly-recallable delegates to vote on structural matters that impact the global network as a whole (this could be related to resource allocation, technology, network infrastructure, organization structure, and more).

**Have a cooperative or collective in any of the areas below? Reach out, plug in, and let’s federate.**

- Design
- Music Production
- Film Production
- Event Production
- Game Development
- Web Development and Design

_**Remember:** The legal “co-op” designation does not mean that 1) all co-ops are committed to democracy internally or 2) committed to a more democratic community and/or world. In addition to the quality of what groups are bringing to our network, collective commitment to direct democracy both internally (within respective groups) and externally (within wider communities and society) is what we are most concerned with gauging._

## Notes on Financing

As of **September 2021,** we intend to generate revenue through **equity crowdfunding** paired with **live events** and **parties.**

Startup capital will be provided by co-op members with _optional_ guarantee of return of **principal investment (no interest)** once the co-op has become profitable, and we also intend to allow **“supporter shares,”** which offer **angel investors and/or donors** the _potential_ for a return of **preferred interest,** but **no _guarantees_ of a return _or_ voting rights** in the governance of Jaded hubs and co-ops.

We also intend to issue **patronage dividends** for members of the co-ops once they have become profitable.
