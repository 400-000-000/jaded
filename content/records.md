**Currently Looking For:**

• **Black/African American** *(generational roots in North America)* vocalists, instrumentalists, producers, and/or composers *(church background preferred).*\
• **Indigenous** vocalists, instrumentalists, producers, and/or composers.\
• **Japanese** and/or **Japanese American** vocalists, instrumentalists, producers, and/or composers.\
• Orchestral and/or electronic composers, and songwriters of any ethnic/racial background.\

\
**Notes on Outreach:**

• Artists based in NYC or the tri-state area are preferred.\
• Artists of any gender and/or sexual orientation are accepted.\
• Those involved with Jaded Records **do not** operate on *purely transactional* terms – we are interested in building relationships and trust with one another as *humans* first, and letting that inform how we create and build together.\
• Those involved with Jaded Records are trying to **cooperate** with one another in order to make a comfortable living off of music *(no need for excess).* For us, this requires more of a *collective* mindset, trust, and focus that places emphasis on how we can support one another in bringing in the resources necessary for *all* to thrive, while also shifting culture through music. This also means we operate off of a cooperative "business" model (please see **[THE STRUCTURE](https://jaded.site/about)** section of our *About* page for more on this).\
• Please provide a **brief bio** and **some examples of your work** if reaching out. You **DO NOT** need to have "buzz" or "numbers" in order to send us some of your work; we are fully aware that some of the best music being made right now is flying *completely* under the radar due to saturation and a lack of infrastructure for both artist development and promotion/marketing. Together (and cooperatively), this is precisely what we aim to address.\
